If you’re out of the know or have saved yourself from the clutches of social media, notably X, West has recently resurfaced due to many outbursts he has had online. Some of these outbursts range from pure unadulterated hating on other celebrities to being pro Nazi. Although it may seem out of nowhere, West has already hinted at everything crashing down years before. West has been known to bring up his mental issues in his music before, even creating a whole album with his bipolarity as a focus (West 2018). In his movie “Runaway,” West portrays himself as confused and even ‘lost in the world’ as he acts as himself (Bean 2019). In a rendition of one of his most popular songs, “Runaway,” West lets out one last cry for help that continues to add more depth to his already emotional song while also showing the death of the “old”, more sane West. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">West performed a version of the song “Runaway” at the Free Larry Hoover Concert on December 9, 2021. Watching the playback online, it's clear he meant it as a cry for Kim Kardashian, who would soon divorce him, to return. “Runaway” was released on November 22, 2010, under Roc-A-Fella Records as part of West’s album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an album considered West’s magnum opus, “Runaway” stands out as the longest song and represents the “climax” of the story the album tells. Just on its own, the song has conjured multitudes of interpretations from its listeners, ranging from the song representing the apology for the political drama at the time with Taylor Swift to creating an anthem for people to accept who they are. To add to the complexity, West modified some lyrics in his performance at the Free Larry Hoover Concert to represent what the song meant to him at that time. By destigmatizing mental health issues through revealing his issues in the performance and relating to his audience, West opens the floor for people to look out for and speak up more about mental health. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this rendition of “Runaway,” West packs much more emotion than the original studio recording to increase his relatability to the audience, destigmatizing the idea of mental health problems. More specifically, West shows more emotion through changes in his voice and making lyric choices that portray himself as a hopeless romantic. The performance itself can be summarized into two halves, with the first half having the same lyrics as the first half of the studio recording, and the second half is filled with West singing his sorrows. Throughout the performance, West subtly inflects his voice to higher pitches than the album recording, pointing to his vulnerability at the time, right after Kardashian had already begun separating herself from West. By doing so, West clarifies that he is revealing his true feelings to the crowd and isn’t just performing a song. As Kardashian puts it in an interview, “[He] wears his heart on his sleeve and says exactly what he wants to say” (Bailey 2021). West is crying for help and is not afraid to use it to connect with his audience through relatability. In addition, the first half of the performance helps to point out West’s downfalls as a person, helping to highlight his tendency to ruin relationships around him and how apologetic he is for it. This is because for the first few minutes, West performs the same lyrics as the studio recording and it is these lyrics that highlight points such as “You been putin’ up with my sh*t just way too long” and “I just blame everything on you” (West, 2010b). Pitchfork also mentions how West can “show some of the self-awareness that comes with time” (Breihan 2010). From the get-go, West makes it clear that this is an emotional rendition of the song and is extremely personal by being relatable to the audience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he finishes the first half, the music begins to fade into just a soft piano tune in the background. West begins with crying out the same lyrics, asking someone to “runaway from me, baby” (West, 2021). It is only at the end of the song that it is revealed he is addressing Kardashian when he states, “More specifically Kimberly” (West, 2021). As he sings, he switches from asking her to run away to asking himself to run away, drawing a connection between him and Kardashian; they are running from the same person: himself. In essence, West is aware of his problems and mental health struggles. He wants people to listen and realize the warning signs he is portraying. This is further highlighted by the somber tone of the performance, with only the piano playing in the background and West staring down as he performs, almost as if he were opening up to a therapist. The soft piano helps to play into this emotion, underscoring his voice as the crowd falls silent. West humanizes himself in this light and relates to his listeners over internal struggles, such as blaming oneself for everything. West also talks about his awareness of his shortcomings in the media. In an interview, he stated, “Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure” (West 2013). West uses his struggles as a gateway to resonate with the audience, demonstrating that one is not alone in struggling with their mental health and that West himself is human, just like them. West throws the reality of struggling with one's mental health into the limelight, all while destigmatizing the act of calling for help. He is essentially a case study for recognizing these warning signs from such emotional outpourings and raw emotions, especially considering how he has changed recently. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But under a different light, this song represents the death of this side of Kanye. West has mentioned before that he has sides, with a whole album dedicated to his bipolarity diagnosis in 2016 (Berman and Boguski 2020). And taking this performance as his last cry for help, it could easily be seen in some ways as the death of this side of West. After this emotional outcry for Kardashian, West has been in nothing but drama in the news for his just distasteful outbursts, among many other things, including sexist and racist remarks. Overall, comparing West to how he was before shows the consequences of ignoring internal struggles, and despite his awareness of the issue, he let himself self-destruct. In this performance, West’s outpouring of emotion helps destigmatize mental health issues to draw more attention to the problems and show people the harsh consequences of ignoring them. </span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZUzfyWQkEI?si=929M0Nvb1KPJ2Jm2" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div><p class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/critical-reading-assignment.html">West Vs.
