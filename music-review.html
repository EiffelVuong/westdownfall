If you’re out of the know or have saved yourself from the clutches of social media, notably X, West has recently resurfaced due to many outbursts he has had online through the platform X. Some of these outbursts include pure unadulterated hating on other celebrities to being pro Nazi. Although it may seem out of nowhere, West already hinted at everything crashing down years before. In a rendition of one of his most popular songs, “Runaway,” West lets out one last cry for help that just continues to add more depth to his already emotional and deeply meaningful song. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Runaway” was released on November 22, 2010, under Roc-A-Fella Records as part of West’s album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. In an album considered West’s magnum opus, “Runaway” stands out as the longest song and represents the ‘climax’ of the story the album tells. Just on its own, the song has conjured multitudes of interpretations from its listeners, ranging from the song representing the apology for the political drama at the time with Taylor Swift to creating an anthem for people to accept who they are. To add to the complexity, West modified some lyrics in a performance to represent what the song meant to him at that time. West performed this version of the song at the Free Larry Hoover Concert on December 9, 2021, as a cry for help for Kim Kardashian, his wife at the time but soon would be divorced, to come back to him. By destigmatizing mental health issues through revealing his issues in the performance and relating to his audience, West opens the floor for people to look out for and speak up more about mental health. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this rendition of “Runaway,” West packs much more emotion than the original studio recording to make himself seem more relatable to the audience, destigmatizing the idea of mental health problems. More specifically, West shows more emotion through changes in his voice and making lyric choices that portray himself as a hopeless romantic. The performance itself can be summarized into two halves, with the first half being the same lyrics as the first half of the studio recording, and the second half is filled with West singing his sorrows. Throughout the performance, West inflects his voice much more than the album recording, pointing to his vulnerability at the time, right after Kim had already begun separating herself from West. By doing so, West clarifies that he is revealing his true feelings to the crowd and isn’t just performing a song. As Kim puts it in an interview, “[He] wears his heart on his sleeve and says exactly what he wants to say”(Bailey 2021). West is crying for help and is not afraid to use it to connect with his audience through relatability. In addition, West's first half of the performance helps to point out his downfalls as a person, helping to highlight his tendency to ruin relationships around him and how apologetic he is for it. This is because for the first few minutes, West performs the same lyrics as the studio recording and it is these lyrics that highlight points such as “You been putin’ up with my sh*t just way too long” and “I just blame everything on you”(West, 2010). Pitchfork also mentions West’s understanding of himself when they mention how West can “show some of the self-awareness that comes with time”(Breihan 2010). From the get-go, West makes it clear that this is an emotional rendition of the song and is extremely personal by being relatable to the audience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he finishes up the first half, the music begins to fade away into just a soft piano tune in the background. West begins with crying out the same lyrics asking someone to “runaway from me, baby”(West, 2021). It is only revealed at the end of the song that he is addressing Kim Kardashain when he states, “More specifically Kimberly” (West, 2021). This is important since as he sings, he switches from asking her to run away to asking himself to run away, drawing a connection between both him and Kim; they are running from the same person: himself. In essence, West is aware of his problems and is aware of his mental health struggles. He wants people to listen and realize these warning signs, as this in itself is him calling out that he knows he’s wrong. This is further highlighted by the somber tone of the performance, with only the piano playing in the background and West staring down as he performs, almost as if West is just opening up to the audience as if they were his therapist. The soft piano also helps to play into this emotion, underscoring his voice as the crowd falls silent. West humanizes himself in this light and relates to his listeners over internal struggles, such as blaming oneself for everything. West also talks about his awareness of his shortcomings in the media. For example, in an interview he stated, “Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure”(West 2013). West uses his struggles as a gateway to resonate with the audience members and listeners, demonstrating that one is not alone in struggling with their mental health and that West himself, despite being such a huge celebrity, is human just like them. This message is important because it throws the reality of struggling with one's mental health into the limelight. By doing so, West destigmatizes the act of calling for help since even as a celebrity, he struggles the same. West’s destigmatization of the topic opens up how he is essentially a case study for recognizing these warning signs from such emotional outpourings and raw emotions, especially considering how he has changed recently. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But under a different light, this song represents the death of this side of Kanye. West has mentioned before that that he has sides, with a whole album dedicated to his bipolarity which was diagnosed in 2016(Berman and Boguski 2020). And taking this performance as his last cry for help, it could also be seen in some ways as the death of this side of West. After this emotional outcry for Kim, West has been in nothing but drama in the news for his just distasteful outbursts among many other things including sexist and racist remarks. As a whole, West, in the current media compared to how he was before, is a case to be made for the whole world to see. The case that what happened to West was the consequence of ignoring one’s internal struggles and despite his awareness of the issue, he let himself self-destruct. Altogether, West’s outperforming of emotion in this performance destigmatizes mental health issues in order to draw more attention to the issues themselves and show people the harsh consequences ignoring them brings. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/critical-reading-assignment.html">West Vs.
