The song, by Kanye West and Pusha T, was released on November 22 of 2010, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under Def Jam Records in the US. It is the album's second most played song and is the album's climax, both musically and lyrically (West 2025b). The lyrics tell a story of West’s self-destructive behaviors and how they ruin his relationship. However, beyond that, the song has been interpreted in many different ways, including West’s multiple interpretations. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of which includes arguably his most famous one, that being that the song serves as an apology to the fellow pop star Taylor Swift for interrupting her victory speech for an award since West thought another artist deserved it (Cullen 2016). This is further explored in the Source Analysis page, which analyzes some of the essential aspects of the song. Some of these include West’s apologetic tone and how the song’s meaning can generate this type of remorseful interpretation. I also note certain contradictions between West’s previous actions on standing against systemic racism so much to standing up against Swift just because she was white to changing to choosing to put on an ‘armor of male whiteness’ in a political sense (Jackson 2018). In other words, West now chooses to portray himself no longer as fighting against systemic racism but just falling into it himself, going as far as supporting anti-semitism on top of many other things (Jackson 2018). This descent may have seemed out of nowhere, but in reality, it was a clear and eventual descent into a state that can only be called lunacy now. This is explored heavily in the Timeline page, in which it's shown West consistently trying to one-up himself with what crazy thing he can say to get him on top of tabloids or news articles. In addition, the Timeline showcases how some of West’s music, especially ‘Runaway’, reflect his actions later on in the future. Such as by providing examples of some of his self-destructive behaviors that he not only outlines in ‘Runaway’ but creates examples of in his online presence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apologetic tone that is first seen in ‘Runaway’ also sparks West's repurposing of the song to sing for his recently broken-up love, Kim Kardashian. I outline this in the Music Review, explicitly analyzing how West hones in much more on being apologetic but asking for forgiveness as he sings. ‘Runaway’ serves much more as an anthem for not only himself but also the other people he sings to in the crowd. He attempts to connect with his audience through this shared experience of a lost love, much like how he describes himself as wanting to be more than just a ‘celebrity’ but a real person, along with everyone else (West 2013). This idea of ‘Runaway’ being a part of his tale of love is also a common interpretation, as seen in the Playlist and Listening Guide, where it shows how ‘Runaway’ stands as a depressive state in the five stages of grief. This connects with the song's apologetic tone and West's desire to connect with the audience through this song, as it shows him being so low in his life that he believes everything was his fault and just wants outward support. Much of this is outlined in the Music Review and stands together overall, along with some of his recent remarks showing how he has turned out.  These actions show West’s main message through the song that ‘Runaway’ is about the importance of human connection and how ignoring these signs of depression and apologies can lead to irreversible harm to one’s character (West 2015). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not being very pop or anthem-coded like some of Kanye’s other major hits like ‘Flashing Lights’ or ‘All of the Lights,’ ‘Runaway’ remains one of his most played songs(even with its staggering 9-minute duration). In addition, West chooses to include nearly 40 seconds of just piano notes at the start and 3 minutes of distorted singing at the end. This type of experimental music isn’t typical in popular pop music, but he makes it work, along with bringing storytelling albums back into the limelight. West also created a 30-minute movie for this song, showcasing just how important this song was to him and proving that it is so much more than just its lyrics to him (West 2010b). This is important as it shows that West understood the song and its multiple interpretations that can be applicable in many senses, which I hope to explore through this website.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, I hope to showcase how ‘Runaway’ and its musical elements can create a story of love and apologies that should educate people on the importance of mental health awareness. In addition, I hope to showcase how ‘Runaway’ mirrors West’s personal life and how using West as a case study benefits us as his viewers on how we should treat the warning signs West showed his fans. ‘Runaway’ isn’t just a song but rather an invitation by West to see his world of struggles and how others should learn from his suffering. </span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/final-essay.html">Timeline of Events</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
