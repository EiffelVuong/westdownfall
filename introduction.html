Kanye West and Pusha T released the song on November 22, 2010, on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under Def Jam Records in the US. It is the album's second most played song and is the album's climax, both musically and lyrically (West 2025). The lyrics tell a story of West’s self-destructive behaviors and how they ruin his relationship. However, beyond that, the song has been interpreted in many different ways, including West’s multiple interpretations of themes such as the loss of love and mental health awareness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of his most famous moments, West creates his original interpretation of the song: an apology. The song originates as an apology to fellow pop star Taylor Swift for interrupting her victory speech for an award since West believed another artist deserved it (Cullen 2016). The West Vs. Swift page further explores this topic, analyzing some of the song's key aspects. Some of these include West’s apologetic tone and how the song’s meaning can generate this type of remorseful interpretation. I also note certain contradictions between West’s previous actions on standing against systemic racism. For example, West contradicts himself when he initially stands against Swift because she was white, but later on changes to choosing to put on an ‘armor of male whiteness’ in a political sense (Jackson 2018). In other words, West now chooses to portray himself no longer as fighting against systemic racism but just falling into it, going as far as supporting anti-semitism on top of many other things (Jackson 2018). His first major public falling out serves as a precedent for what occurs in the future and is the first significant example we get that his mental health should be watched for. This descent may have seemed out of nowhere, but in reality, it was a clear and eventual descent into a state that can only be called lunacy now. The Timeline page heavily explores this, showing that West consistently tries to one-up himself with the craziest thing he can say to get on the front page of tabloids or news articles. In addition, the Timeline showcases how some of West’s music, especially ‘Runaway’, reflects his actions later on in the future. One of which includes providing examples of some of his self-destructive behaviors, which he not only outlines in ‘Runaway’ but also displays in his online presence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apologetic tone first seen in ‘Runaway’ also sparks West's repurposing of the song to sing about his recently broken-up love, Kim Kardashian. I outline this in the ‘Running in Both Directions’ page, explicitly analyzing how West’s focus on being more apologetic yet asking for forgiveness as he sings serves as an anthem for not only himself but also the other people he sings to in the crowd. He attempts to connect with his audience through this shared experience of lost love, much like how he describes himself as wanting to be more than just a ‘celebrity’ but a real person, like everyone else (West 2013). The idea that ‘Runaway’ is part of his tale of love is also a common interpretation, as seen in the ‘Love To Lost To West’ page, which shows how ‘Runaway’ represents a depressive state in the five stages of grief in the form of a progressive narrative playlist. This connects with the song's apologetic tone and West's desire to connect with the audience through this song, as it shows him at a low point in his life, where he believes everything is his fault and just wants outward support. Much of this is outlined in the ‘Running in Both Directions’ page and stands together overall, along with some of his recent remarks, showing how he has turned out.  These actions show West’s main message through the song that ‘Runaway’ is about the importance of human connection and how ignoring these signs of depression and apologies can lead to irreversible harm to one’s character (West 2015). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not being very pop or anthem-coded like some of Kanye’s other major hits like ‘Flashing Lights’ or ‘All of the Lights,’ ‘Runaway’ remains one of his most played songs (even with its staggering 9-minute duration). In addition, West chooses to include nearly 40 seconds of just piano notes at the start and 3 minutes of distorted singing at the end. This type of experimental music isn’t typical in popular pop music, but he makes it work, along with bringing storytelling albums back into the limelight. West also created a 30-minute movie for this song, showcasing how important it was to him and proving that it is so much more than just its lyrics (West 2010a). West understood the meaning the song held, and in making these odd choices, he creates a piece of music that was meant to be analyzed and explored. West’s erratic music choices in ‘Runaway’ show he understood the song's applicability and multiple interpretations, which I will explore on this website.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, this website lays out how ‘Runaway’ and its musical elements can create a story of love and apology that raises awareness about the importance of mental health. In addition, I showcase how ‘Runaway’ mirrors West’s personal life and how using West as a case study benefits us, as his viewers, in understanding how to treat the warning signs he showed. ‘Runaway’ isn’t just a song, but rather an invitation by West to see his world of struggles and how others should learn from his suffering. </span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/final-essay.html">Timeline of Events</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/" class="al" target="_self">Homepage</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/critical-reading-assignment.html" class="al" target="_self">West Vs.
