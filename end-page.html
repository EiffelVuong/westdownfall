We can only hope that in the future, he will eventually realize the consequences of his actions, but for now, all we can do is watch along and see how he tops whatever he just said on X until he can no longer go any crazier than his last tweet. Despite all this however, West will always be one of the greatest artists of our generation. From the days when "he'd be in his bedroom making beats with the same clothes on for days, no haircut or nothing"(Al-Gharbi 2018) to himself being described by critics as undoubtedly "absolutely one of the best, and you could make the argument for the best artist of the 21st century"(Olabode 2023). West will always hold a special place in the history of modern century music, along with everything he has done recently to destroy any credibility he had before. As the years go on, he may continue to fall into this postitive cycle, however hopefully, something or someone will intervene and save West because despite him saving many with his music, no one has saved him from himself.</p><h3>What Kanye does nowadays -&gt;  <a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/ye-now.html">'Ye' Now</a><a></a></h3><p> </p><p><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p><p><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/final-essay.html">Back to Timeline</a></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/" class="al" target="_self">Homepage</a></li><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/critical-reading-assignment.html" class="al" target="_self">West Vs.
