Sitting in a dark room, alone in your head, banging on the walls physically and mentally. Every small thing in your room seems to remind you of the past, yet you’re too scared to take down the small colorful trinkets or the hand-made notes. You're in denial, yet you know deep down your life has changed forever. You can’t think, and everything seems to be falling apart. Among the sea of your thoughts, they all share one commonality: love. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of others worldwide share the same fate as you; between them, music is almost always a part of how people cope with their loss.  In my playlist, I go through the songs people play in the different stages as they manage their breakups. Focusing mainly on lyrics and the structure, this playlist creates a story on its own as it flows through the story of one’s love and how quickly a love can turn into a long process of including but not limited to denial, bargaining, and acceptance. This playlist dives into not only love and heartbreak but also how it happened for Kanye West himself. The main song of this playlist is “Runaway” by Kanye West, and it serves as the climax of this playlist in terms of West’s story of heartbreak and serves as the depressive episode of the playlist. It’s a song of pure love so bad that it tells its lover to ‘run away’ since they know how bad they are. One of West’s more popular songs, it sets itself apart with its lengthy runtime yet entrances its listeners throughout the whole listen, from the clear yet thought-piercing piano notes at the start to the eerie distorted voice and guitar at the end. And when that piercing E piano key is played at a concert, it's a sign to listen, and the crowd immediately goes silent, a stark contrast to how most of his other songs go, such as “Power” or “Carnival.” It’s the first time the wind can be felt and heard since entering the venue, chilling the air around you, yet it's fitting for such a song. And as West speaks his soul into the microphone, everyone holds their breath, feeling a tightness in their chest as they listen and feel unified in their combined heartbreak. </span></p><p><strong><br></strong><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the playlist/love, one must first fall in love. “Disco” by Surf Curse reminds us of that lyrically and in terms of the music elements. The song talks about being unable to wait for someone because of how entrancing they are. It’s sappy, but a lot of it is true when you realize that many relationships start with people being unable to keep their minds off of someone else. This song also has the highest BPM and is the most upbeat of all the songs on this playlist, representing a fleeting love that is just starting to bloom. Remember this upbeatness as this also helps to contrast itself from the other songs since there isn’t anything wrong with the love. It is love in its purest form with no impurities since it has just begun. This explains the song's placement since, as it will become apparent, this love only becomes more and more stained as the songs continue.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mirrors” follows up right after, a song about what it feels like to be in “love.” This song is the second song on the playlist for two main reasons. One is that it represents how it feels to be in love with someone in this playlist, specifically with Timberlake calling their significant other a “reflection” of himself and seeing his love everywhere. The song’s message is very important for the placement of this song since it represents the in love portion of the story this playlist attempts to create. Another reason is that it mirrors “Runaway” in this playlist. The structure of the playlist has both songs in similar places, with “Mirrors” in the second slot and “Runaway” in the second-to-last slot. This was intentional as “Mirrors” talks so heavily about seeing one’s lover as just a reflection of themself and how much they love that their lover is so alike to them. Yet, despite how in love this may seem, it sets up for the heartbreak itself in the future, revealing how it is this narcissism itself that breaks down the relationship. “Mirrors” also constantly repeats “you are the love my life”(35 times) yet talks so candidly about the almost blatant narcissism coursing through the song, already revealing some of the shortcomings of the relationship of this playlist. “Runaway” deals into this too, since much of the song focuses on blaming oneself. The structures of the songs are also eerily similar, with both being much longer than usual, an 8-minute runtime and a 9-minute runtime for “Mirrors” and “Runaway”, respectively, and the ends for both songs are just repetitive with intangible lyrics. These are all important things to note, as they’ll be explained further on in the section on “Runaway.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the flaws already begin to show themselves, “Losing You” follows up next on the playlist, revealing how it feels as if the relationship is falling apart. The song expresses how it feels to begin having doubts about a partner. The music still feels and sounds very endearing, almost like it's not entirely too serious, yet it’s scary to think about the thought of losing your partner. But the lyrics paint a different story, one where it's said how the problems of the relationship are known, but they’ll be kept hidden to preserve the relationship. This song follows the typical path of realizing something is wrong, yet you’re not exactly sure what is wanted out of you. This song is also a good contrast to “Runaway,” in which this song is so scared of “losing” someone, yet “Runaway” is essentially promoting that action as it’ll be seen later. Pay attention to these contrasting meanings as this sets up and shows the playlist's development as the songs follow this love story. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite it all, everything good has to end. In “Someone You Loved,” the flaws and problems build up to the breakup. It’s a sad song, much like “Runaway,” yet out of the rest of the songs as it’ll be seen, it's the most surface-level form of being broken up with. The music is mainly composed of the piano in the background and Capaldi’s voice, with its lyrics only pointing to just essentially saying in a one-dimensional way that they were the ones that were broken up with, and it was not their choice. This song represents being broken up with after all the build-up of falling in love, realizing the problems, and keeping them hidden until it blows up, resulting in the breakup. The song is sad, yet later when “Runaway” is described, its clear the sadness in the song is much more of a “disappointed” type of sad instead of the more depressed vibes that “Runaway” gives. So note the voice of Capaldi, how much louder it is, and how much emphasis is put on it since it will help highlight both of their respective songs in their respective stages of this story. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The love story has officially ended at song four, with five more songs to go, which is representative of the fact that it sometimes takes longer to recover from a relationship than the actual length of it. In addition, the following five songs represent the five stages of grief, which are usually prevalent in many breakups and coping processes. For the first stage, denial, the song is  “Stay With Me”. A soft tone is kept throughout the song, indicating a somber mood, and it is interpretable as both a love song and one begging for love back. It represents the denial stage, as the lyrics throughout the song indicate that the lover should stay without considering anything else about the relationship. It coincides much with the previous song since both are focused on losing the relationship and just wanting it back. In this type of song, pay attention to its energy and notice how you can feel the energy that the person is still in love with their ex.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it becomes less evident in the next stage of grief as the next song, “Hurts Me,” represents the anger stage. In the song, the lyrics paint a picture of someone who blames everything happening on the other person who broke up with them and was not empathetic enough, and that they, too, had a large part in why it didn’t work out. This song is much faster than the other songs that have been played before this besides “Disco”, to represent the anger one would feel in this stage. It's a quicker song, representing the rise in heartbeat you’d feel after getting heated over thinking about how you supposedly feel like none of this was your fault. It’s important to note also the more upbeat feel to this song, as it is a warm-up towards the bargaining stage in the next song. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To follow up, along comes a more upbeat song to follow that warm-up: "Too Good to Say Goodbye.” This song represents the bargaining stage of grief in which it feels “too good to say goodbye.” Within it, a line is said that is typical of the bargaining stage during a breakup, specifically, “You ain’t never gonna find a love like mine.” Saying that the love they had was unique and it wasn’t something you could just find anywhere. On top of that, it is explicitly stated, “Why can’t we try and start again?” Literally bargaining to try to get back together. The song is more upbeat and happy than the others since it tries to convince the listener that staying is worth it. It is the final stage before everything comes crashing down; however, since it's the last genuine and effortful attempt at trying to get them back, represented by how the song has a much more positive sound to it, its lyrics are practically begging to get back together.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, everything comes crashing down in “Runaway.” The playlist hits its ultimate low and climax in the same song, representing the depressive stage in grief and is when West finally realizes he is the one in the wrong. The song itself is nothing short of enlightening, with the song itself perfectly encapsulating the types of feelings to finally hit the low of knowing it's over. The deep heaviness of the bass and drums in the background makes it feel like it's hard to get through every line, as if you were wading through heavy mud. Yet every line that West sings is clear and coherent, blaming himself for everything and pleading with his ex that they should just leave him behind forever or “run away.” It also encapsulates a depressive episode through West’s voice, with his emotion and soul being so clear even when rapping. It is clear that there is still care for the other person, but the overwhelming sadness finally crashes down and leads to one blaming themself for everything. This contrasts significantly with “Mirrors” in how before, the love was focused on the narcissism and how much they loved themself, but now it's turned the other way around, and now they blame themselves for everything. This generates two meanings: one that they are so narcissistic they still believe everything was always about them and everything was their fault, or that they are realizing that it was this trait of narcissism that they lost this relationship, hence West blaming himself. And at the end of “Runaway,” there is this long stretch of just a distorted West singing, much like at the end of “Mirrors” where there is this long stretch of just Timberlake singing with no lyrics. The mirror here represents how these are both peaks, one at the height of their love and the other at the bottom of their love. </span></p><p><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/music-review.html">To Music Review</a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we go to the final song representing the stage of acceptance, “Ghost Town.” This song by West is about just letting oneself go. He has let himself do that, especially with recent media portraying it. Compared to his more soulful voice in “Runaway,” West feels complacent and almost happy. He includes lyrics of “letting go” and feeling free, which represent acceptance that it is now over. He talks about the past too, about trying to make them love him again, indicative of the previous songs in this playlist trying to bargain or be in denial, yet nothing works, so he accepts it. However, everything that has led up to here has been straightforward and there isn’t much argument except for this final stage. Acceptance means different things to different people; in West's case, he let himself go unrecoverably. But in many others, people continue on, constantly harboring their dream when they had everything. The crossed out song in the playlist, “Always,” represents this different ending. It is one in which you continue, still saddened but happy it happened, as described by the soft tone of the song and hopeful lyrics stating that you’d never forget the experience. However, in this story of love for West, that isn’t what happened, and he took the way out that has led him to change as a person forever. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is over, yet does it ever really end? You continue with your life, and sometimes you may forget about it, but down in your heart, you cling onto those feelings because sometimes it's just one of those things that never leave. Those memories will fade into the background, but like an old song, they’re waiting to be replayed, and when you let the music from your speakers fill your thoughts as you drive home or that familiar piano key pierces the air at a crowded venue, for a moment those memories will come rushing back. You remember it all again like it was yesterday, yet nothing could fill that gap in your heart. You felt love and truly miss it, but this time is different than the first; you remember everything, but now you just listen, feel, and let it all go. </span></p><h3 class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/final-essay.html">To Timeline</a></h3><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
