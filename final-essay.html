Whether it be for a record-breaking album that people are raving about or, more recently, for becoming a fully-fledged Twitter Nazi who just rants on and on about his previous relationships and bringing others down, West is always at the forefront of the media, it seems. Although some of (or rather many) of his actions may seem very random and out of character for what people previously viewed West as, it is possible to see after digesting earlier warning signs in his hit songs from over a decade ago that he was already on his descent to what most would call pure madness. </span></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM.png" alt="" width="516" height="534" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-xs.png 640w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-sm.png 768w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-md.png 1024w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-lg.png 1366w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-xl.png 1600w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.07.28-AM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p class="align-center"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">West donning a KKK-adjacent robe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(West 2025).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When put into a timeline of events, I think it's pretty clear to see the downward trend of West’s moral character as a whole. For example, an overview of this timeline can be seen with his release of ‘Runaway’ compared to his more controversial release of ‘The Life of Pablo’, his controversial choice to support pro-White movements and Trump publicly, and his antisemitic remarks on Twitter. However, in this post, I’ll break down the whole trendline from the beginning to the modern-day West to make it more transparent and reveal a connection between his hit song ‘Runaway’ and how it all loops in with what he’s been up to nowadays. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>2010</strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">West released his hit album, which is considered his magnum opus, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and within it includes a nearly 10-minute song titled ‘Runaway’. At the time, West was already at the top of the news headers, not for the album's popularity but rather for some of his actions at an award show. Specifically, West had interrupted Taylor Swift during one of her acceptance speeches as West believed that the award belonged to another person but was only given to Swift due to racial politics (Cullen 2016). Reflecting on his actions, however, West then released ‘Runaway’ as a “back-handed apology to Swift”(Cullen 2016). Analyzing the song’s lyrics, it is clear to see that West was truly apologetic for himself at the time, using phrases such as “I just blame everything on you” or saying that “You been puttin’ up with my sh*t just way too long” to show he was genuinely apologetic for who he was as a person (West 2010). Despite this, however, the song could then be interpreted as West stating that he is sorry for who he is, but can’t change anything since the song itself tells its listener to ‘Runaway’, as in West himself won’t change for anybody; he is just sorry for the damage he brings. Even as far as over a decade and a half ago, we can see hints of West realizing his character is highly flawed, but he only reveals this aspect first as an apology to Swift during an award speech. As time goes on, however, West will only continue to be less apologetic for the increasingly devious actions he ends up enacting. </span></p><p><strong>2016 - 2017</strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Name one genius that ain’t crazy” (West 2016) is a lyric on his song ‘Feedback’ in his album The Life Of Pablo. The lyric is self-explanatory; West is calling himself both crazy and a genius at the same time. It serves to show that West is becoming more self-centered and cocky as the years go on, especially with other incidents going on at the time such as West supporting Bill Cosby despite clear evidence showing he did sexually assualt many women or West calling out brands such as Puma to say they were trying to divide his family (Ungerman 2016). In addition, at a concert during his tour of The Life Of Pablo, West states that he would’ve voted for Trump if he had vote (since he apparently didn’t) and states that since the US is inherently a racist country, “Black people should talk less about race” (West 2016). It is clear from this already that West is already taking a more proactive role in voicing his opinions, especially with making sure they are as controversial as possible, which is stated by himself as well, according to a user online stating that he “likes his politically incorrect way of communication” (West 2016). At this point, West hasn’t completely fallen into what would be called lunacy however he is already growing more cocky and mad at this time. He isn’t afraid to pull punches just because of Internet cancel culture, which is what many celebrities of his caliber would and should be scared of, since it seems that at this point, he already believes that he is indestructible. And with the media constantly covering what he says and how his music is popular no matter the circumstance, it certainly makes sense that he would feel this way and that it would only be a positive feedback loop as the years go on. </span></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Jg5wkZ-dJXA?si=JuELPTQY_IjS5wvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West 'Runaway' Movie</a></p><p><strong>2018 - 2022</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">West continues with his Twitter madness, only diving deeper into his controversial takes. In 2018, he made a post stating, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hear about slavery for 400 years … For 400 years? That sounds like a choice” (Harmeet 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It's clear that there is a downward trend in what West has been saying over the years. Its as if he feels the need to one-up himself every time he says something controversial, whether to stay at the top of news or just for his cockiness. Taking into account this general trend, it's easy to see that what West outlined in his original song ‘Runaway’ is slowly becoming more faithful to his character as the years go on, precisely the fact that he is who he is no matter if he apologizes for it or not. Especially with such a large status and influence over young culture, West is extremely immature with his privilege and influence to a point that it should be taken away (in fact, this did happen but only for 8 months). However, West takes one last look back at his previous self when he performs at the Free Larry Hoover Concert. In this concert, he cries back to his recently divorced wife Kim Kardashian, asking her to come back, and is clearly emotional throughout the song, showcasing his final call for help before finally descending into lunacy (West 2021). After this, he truly falls as a celebrity, posting antisemitic remarks online and just losing all form of credibility as a persona online. He also loses his deals with Adidas and Gap, forcing him to lose his billionaire status and become an evil ghost of his past(Dellatto 2022).</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/music-review.html">Music Review - Free Larry Hoover Concert</a></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM.png" alt="" width="434" height="439" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-xs.png 640w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-sm.png 768w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-md.png 1024w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-lg.png 1366w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-xl.png 1600w, https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Shot-2025-04-15-at-9.08.32-AM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p class="align-center"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">West wearing a ‘white lives matter’ shirt </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Owens 2022)</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>2024-2025</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, towards more modern news, West has failed to break the mold and has still pushed on with forcing himself to say crazier and crazier things. Even went so far as to accuse his divorced wife of sex trafficking with their daughter, North West(West 2025). In addition, he has gone entirely Nazi, stating that he is a Nazi and that he even knows it himself (West 2025). As a whole, West has fallen to depths from which it cannot come back. But one thing can be learned from it, and it's that he knew this was who he was from the very beginning. It was in West’s character to be unapologetic for who he was, despite the first time saying that he was apologizing to Swift. West knows who he is as a person and decides that the best use of his influence as a celebrity is to voice his anti-Semitic opinions and other controversial rants online for everyone to see. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annotated Bibliography</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cullen, Shaun. 2016. “The Innocent and the Runaway: Kanye West, Taylor Swift, and the Cultural Politics of Racial Melodrama.” Journal of Popular Music Studies.
