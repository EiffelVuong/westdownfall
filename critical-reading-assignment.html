Swift: A Source Analysis</h1></div></header></div><div class="entry-wrapper content__entry"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the article “The Innocent and the Runaway: Kanye West, Taylor Swift, and the Cultural Politics of Racial Melodrama,” Shaun Cullen analyzes both the motivations behind and responses to the Kanye West and Taylor Swift drama during the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards(VMAs), with a significant focus on both of their response performances to the whole ordeal of West standing up for Beyonce. Specifically, during Swift’s award speech, West interrupted her by storming on stage to take the mic and arguing on stage that Beyonce deserved the award, not Swift (Cullen 2016). Cullen argues for West that despite his controversial actions and takes, he was the only level-headed and closest to an innocent person during the whole drama. Ultimately, this showcases how West’s actions should be closely scrutinized and generalized to represent mental health issues. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cullen begins by examining both Swift’s performance of “Innocent” and her fans' ideas of Kanye. He describes Swift and her fans as containing a “conservative imaginary,” which helped to foreclose the space of healing that West tried to create in his performance of “Runaway” (Cullen 2016). Cullen broadens the scope of the whole drama to the political dramas that were occurring during the year after as well, which involved radicalization and gender and only aided in pushing the average viewer’s view of West to be “like Barack Obama, as a demonic, black interloper and Swift as an innocent, white victim” (Cullen 2016). Cullen is referring to how there are many stereotypes surrounding a black to white racial conflict, and that these points have been brought up recently as well regarding Obama as the president. Cullen argues that West is just misunderstood and that the general population, in this instance, is wrong because they’ve been primed to think this way from the modern societal and political landscape. To back up this point, Cullen draws upon when West had an outburst during the Concert for Hurricane Relief after Katrina, in which Cullen insists that despite West’s way of going about it, he was reflective of the current political and global situation, racial and gender identities (Cullen 2016). Those being of the stereotypes surrounding a black man a white woman conflict, along with the political landscape and controversy around a black president.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2327335/kanye-west-taylor-swift.png?w=1200&amp;f=67d2e8d469a40ec54c066220c709309a" alt="kanye west and taylor swift arguing" width="702" height="468" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p class="align-center"><em>West arguing with a shocked Swift (Kravitz 2009)</em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cullen separates his essay into two major parts: His analysis of Swift’s performance of “Innocent” and West’s performance of “Runaway” both at the VMAs. Throughout both, Cullen deeply analyzes the movements and symbolism behind each of the performances, going as far as deciphering Swift’s attire as being indicative of the white working class and essentially white supremacy. He considers both performances at their intended purpose and the underlying meanings, especially in the context of the political state of the world in 2016, with Barack soon leaving office and Trump entering, and previous literature such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone with the Wind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As Cullen analyzed Swift’s performance more, he began transitioning into describing how Swift would slight West, and Cullen would refute it, essentially marking Swift as the “enemy” in this essay. For example, Cullen states West’s point is on how Beyonce’s labor is valued differently than Swift’s, but goes on to show how Swift interprets it as seeing herself as “innocent” and “that she is Knowles[Beyonce’s] equal” (Cullen 2016). Just doing this also slights Swift because she is now seen as ignorant and believes all this is about herself, drawing a parallel to how most see West. These are significant points that Cullen effectively makes that paint the situation in a completely different light than it seems at first glance. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cullen could have presented more counterarguments to believe in Swift’s innocence and humanize her more. When describing West’s performance, Cullen goes as far as describing her set as an “uncanny space of white supremacist fantasy” (Cullen 2016). Yet Cullen chooses not to slight West when describing Swift’s performance, only going as far as calling West “brash” or slightly “misogynistic.” At the same time, Cullen only defends Swift by stating that “we cannot blame Swift directly for this slight” (Cullen 2016). Instead, Cullen could have explained Swift’s ideals more or brought more evidence from other sources beyond just one of Swift’s performances, and implemented them into both sections. In addition, Cullen focuses a little too much on West’s positive messages and chooses not to dilute them with examples that show more negative aspects of West. Cullen did not elaborate at all on West’s other political outbursts or other less redeeming qualities, and it is apparent throughout the essay that West stands out as the “hero” of the story. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Cullen makes great arguments using large-scope connections to the political world and deep analyses of the artists’ responses to the situation. Cullen critically analyzes and describes much of “Runaway” and its nuances as both an apology to Swift and a generational anthem for the people. For example, Cullen uses West’s voice and his choice to use as little autotune as possible compared to his previous songs as a way to represent his authenticity and sincerity to Swift while also doubling as a way for him to implore his listeners to truly listen to what he as to say this time (Cullen 2016). Cullen clearly understands the song, allowing the readers to understand the complexity and why West was the only one who truly understood the situation, not Swift. </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/3/gallery/599f7cd3b065da76088b4568.webp" data-size="846x423"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/3/gallery/599f7cd3b065da76088b4568-thumbnail.webp" alt="west performing 'runaway'" width="720" height="360"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/3/gallery/110997-taylor_swift_shows_vmas_2010_617_409.webp" data-size="617x409"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/media/posts/3/gallery/110997-taylor_swift_shows_vmas_2010_617_409-thumbnail.webp" alt="swift performing 'innocent'" width="617" height="409"></a></figure></div></div><p class="align-center"><em>West and Swift both performing at the VMAs of their respective songs 'Runaway' and 'Innocent'. Left: (Acuna 2023) Right: (Lipshutz 2010)</em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Cullen’s article presents a detailed analysis of both artists’ performances, representing different sides of the same racial drama. Despite Cullen’s bias towards West’s choices and his ideals, he does an excellent job of detailing the underlying symbolisms and meanings in both Swift’s and West’s performances that truly show the politics behind their creation. By doing so, Cullen showcases great and essential ways to understand music, such as making connections to not just historical but also political and racial contexts. Cullen also presents great examples of applications of musical analysis, such as analyzing the difference in voice recording or performance analysis, like examining the setting to bring out meaning. Altogether, Cullen provides a meaningful and insightful analysis of the performances of “Innocent” and “Runaway” as responses to not only the artists’ drama but the political and racial undertones as well. As a whole, West’s outburst had an apparent effect on not only his mental health but the public's view of his mental health, initiating the start of an inevitable descent into his ruin. </span></p><h5 class="align-center"><br><br><br><br><strong><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/final-essay.html">To Timeline</a></strong><br><br><br><br><br><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/music-review.html">Back to 'Running in Both Directions'</a><br><br><br><br><br><br></h5></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/" class="al" target="_self">Homepage</a></li><li><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://eiffelvuong.github.io/westdownfall/critical-reading-assignment.html" class="al" target="_self">West Vs.
